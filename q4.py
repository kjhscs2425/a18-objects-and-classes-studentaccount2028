# Write a new class `Point` with these methods:
# `__init__` sets `self.x` and `self.y`.
# `__str__` returns "(x, y)" for your object's x- and y-coordinates.
# `draw`:
#    1. uses `turtle.goto` to go to that x and y coordinate
#    2. stamps a point with `turtle.dot`


# Make 4 new objects of the class Point: (0, 0), (100, 0), (100, 100), (0, 100)
# Print your objects.
# Run your draw method for that object.


#### OPTIONAL extra credit ####
# The `str` function will run the `__str__` method for an object. Use the
# `turtle.write` method and the `str` function to add a label to your point
# when you draw it.
